# Troubleshooting

As with a lot of computer issues, the very first thing you should try is to restart everything. While not strictly
necessary, we recommend that you start your device and the Intiface server before Minecraft. This should solve most
intermittent issues.

If you run this mod alongside other mods, try disabling them all first and then reenable them one by one when the mods
run successfully. If you found any mods that are incompatible with this mod, please file an issue on
our [issue tracker](https://github.com/RainbowVille/minegasm/issues).
