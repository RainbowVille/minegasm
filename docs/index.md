Notes:
* For version 1.12&ndash;1.16, you need to set your Minecraft installation to use Java 11 or later instead of the bundled Java 8.
* The mod for v1.12.2 is reported to be broken.

Old releases can be found on the [release page](./releases).

### Dependencies
1. Intiface Central: [https://intiface.com/central/](https://intiface.com/central/)
2. Minecraft Forge: the versions mentioned on the corresponding Forge column above are the tested versions (newer versions are probably okay) 

## How to Use
1. Make sure you have all the dependencies installed.
2. Download the JAR file and put it in your mods directory. If you don't know where your mods directory is, you can simply open your Minecraft, click the 'Mods' button on the main menu, then click 'Open Mods Folder'.
3. Run the Intiface Central and start the server (`ws://localhost:12345`). For advanced users, it is possible to use an Intiface server on a different endpoint by specifying it in the Minegasm config file.
4. Turn on the device.
5. Start Minecraft and connect to a world. If everything works properly, you should see a message stating that Minegasm is connected to your device when you enter the world. If the connection fails, go back to Intiface Central and make sure that the Server Status shows that the server is running. To force Minegasm to retry to connect, leave the world and then re-enter.
6. Have fun!

For more detailed instructions, please see the [setup page](./setup).

## Known Issues
* In-game config menu is missing for 1.13, 1.17, 1.18, 1.19, and 1.20. The mod can still be configured manually by editing the config file.
* The mod has only undergone limited testing in multiplayer mode and it might not work with some mods.

Make sure to check out our [issue tracker](https://github.com/RainbowVille/minegasm/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Abug) for all the known issues and their status. The [troubleshooting page](./troubleshoot) provides suggestions of things to do if you encounter any issues.

## Supported Devices
In theory, this mod should be compatible with any devices on this list: [IoST Index â€“ Vibrators with Buttplug.io Support](https://iostindex.com/?filter0ButtplugSupport=4&filter1Features=OutputsVibrators)

It has been confirmed by the developers to work with:
- [Lovense Edge](https://www.lovense.com/r/qvl9jn) (prostate massager)
- [Lovense Hush](https://www.lovense.com/r/zrzb5e) (butt plug)
- [Lovense Max 2](https://www.lovense.com/r/n4x2bh) (male masturbator)
- [Lovense Domi 2](https://www.lovense.com/r/khhgol?t=m1) (wand)

Note that at the moment it doesn't work with any other devices that are not vibrators.

## Configuration
Minegasm is configurable through the `Mods > Config` screen, as well as by manually editing the `minegasm-client.toml` config file.
The [config page](./config) explains this in further details.

|-----------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| NORMAL    | The toy will vibrate when you attack other entities, mine, or gain XP.                                                                                       |

## Support
In principle, we do not provide any dedicated (technical) supports. If you need any assistance, you can use the [discussion page](https://github.com/RainbowVille/minegasm/discussions).
Alternatively, you can join `@RSwoop`'s [Discord server](https://discord.gg/Kc7ueWC) and ping him in the `#minegasm` channel, but please be advised that he might not always be able to help you.
A dedicated server for Minegasm is planned to be set up in the future.

If you have any suggestions or found any bugs, please post them to our [issue tracker](https://github.com/RainbowVille/minegasm/issues) on GitHub. Please try to be as descriptive as possible and include your `debug.log` (please remove any references to your username first if that matters). The `debug.log` file is typically under the `logs` directory of your minecraft instance. In the vanilla installation on Windows, it is typically on `<drive>:\Users\<username>\AppData\Roaming\.minecraft`.

The status of confirmed bugs and planned future enhancements are available on our [project board](https://github.com/RainbowVille/minegasm/projects/1).

## History
The mod was conceived in 2020 by `RSwoop` amid the COVID-19 pandemic to combine his newly-found interest of connected intimate adult toys and Minecraft, that he played a lot during the lockdown.
When researching about the idea, he found that something similar has been done 5 years prior, but [the project](https://old.reddit.com/r/SexToys/comments/3ja9uq/vibrating_egg_controlled_by_a_raspberry_pi_and/) was made for a specific toy and had not been developed further.
He then decided to make his own mod that would work with more off-the-shelf devices using the [Buttplug.io](https://buttplug.io/) platform, that promised support for a wide range of hardware.

Despite his minimal experience in Java and Minecraft modding, he finally managed to make a working prototype and released it to the public on October 24, 2020 with an open source license, allowing others interested to improve the mod, or even make their own based on it. The mod has since been downloaded thousands of times and has been forked and inspired a few other projects.

The mod was originally designed for PvP duels, which significantly affects some design decisions, but it has since evolved to also support different game modes. The development of the project has slowed down considerably after the pandemic, but it is still being updated occasionally to fix bugs and support newer Minecraft versions.
