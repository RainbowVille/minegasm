While 1.17.1 can use both Java 16 or 17, we recommend 17.  Old releases can be found on the [release page](./releases).

### Dependencies
1. Intiface Central: [https://intiface.com/central/](https://intiface.com/central/)
2. Minecraft Forge: the versions mentioned on the corresponding Forge column above are the tested versions (newer versions are probably okay) 

## How to Use
1. Make sure you have all the dependencies installed.
2. Download the JAR file and put it in your mods directory. If you don't know where your mods directory is, you can simply open your Minecraft, click the 'Mods' button on the main menu, then click 'Open Mods Folder'.
3. Run the Intiface Central and start the server (`ws://localhost:12345`). For advanced users, it is possible to use an Intiface server on a different endpoint by specifying it in the Minegasm config file.
4. Turn on the device.
5. Start Minecraft and connect to a world. If everything works properly, you should see a message stating that Minegasm is connected to your device when you enter the world. If the connection fails, go back to Intiface Central and make sure that the Server Status shows that the server is running. To force Minegasm to retry to connect, leave the world and then re-enter.
6. Have fun!

For more detailed instructions, please see the [setup page](./setup).

## Known Issues
* In-game config menu is missing for 1.13, 1.17, 1.18, 1.19, and 1.20. The mod can still be configured manually by editing the config file.
* The mod has only undergone limited testing in multiplayer mode and it might not work with some mods.

Make sure to check out our [issue tracker](https://github.com/RainbowVille/minegasm/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Abug) for all the known issues and their status. The [troubleshooting page](./troubleshoot) provides suggestions of things to do if you encounter any issues.

## Supported Devices
In theory, this mod should be compatible with any devices on this list: [IoST Index â€“ Vibrators with Buttplug.io Support](https://iostindex.com/?filter0ButtplugSupport=4&filter1Features=OutputsVibrators)

It has been confirmed by the developers to work with:
- [Lovense Edge](https://www.lovense.com/r/qvl9jn) (prostate massager)
- [Lovense Hush](https://www.lovense.com/r/zrzb5e) (butt plug)
- [Lovense Max 2](https://www.lovense.com/r/n4x2bh) (male masturbator)
- [Lovense Domi 2](https://www.lovense.com/r/khhgol?t=m1) (wand)
- Nintendo Joycon (game controller)

Note that at the moment it doesn't work with any other devices that are not vibrators.

## Configuration
Minegasm is configurable through the `Mods > Config` screen, as well as by manually editing the `minegasm-client.toml` config file.
The [config page](./config) explains this in further details.

## Gameplay Modes

| Mode      | Description                                                                                                                                                     |
|-----------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| NORMAL    | The device will vibrate when you attack other entities, mine, or gain XP.                                                                                       |
| MASOCHIST | The device will vibrate when you're hurt or dying.                                                                                                              |
| HEDONIST  | The device will vibrate on all events defined in other modes, except dying (this is replaced, instead, by having the toy vibrate when you're full and healthy). |
| CUSTOM    | The device will vibrate depending on the intensity levels configured by the user.                                                                               |
