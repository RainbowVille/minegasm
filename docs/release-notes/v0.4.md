# v0.4

* Now covers Minecraft 1.12 to 1.20
* Migrated hardware control library to [`buttplug4j`](https://github.com/blackspherefollower/buttplug4j) (this supersedes v0.3)
* Java 11 is required for 1.12.2&ndash;1.16.5 because of the `buttplug4j` library.

## Known Issues
* The mod for 1.12.2 is reported to be broken.
* There is currently a bug in some versions of the Minecraft launcher that prevents the use of newer Java runtimes: [https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MCL-18306](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MCL-18306). This affects the mods for the Minecraft versions before 1.17 as Minegasm requires at least Java 11. If you encounter this issue, a workaround is to delete `JavaCheck.jar` shipped with the launcher.
* In-game config menu is missing for 1.13.2, 1.17.1, 1.18.2, 1.19.4, and 1.20.1. The mod can still be configured manually by editing the config file.
