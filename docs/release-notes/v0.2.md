# v0.2

The mod is now configurable. From the mod config menu, you can choose between 3 predefined modes:

* NORMAL: the toy will vibrate when you attack other entities, mine, or gain XP.
* MASOCHIST: the toy will vibrate when you're hurt or dying.
* HEDONIST: the toy will vibrate on all events defined in other modes, except dying (this is replaced, instead, by
  having the toy vibrate when you're full and healthy).

The fourth CUSTOM mode allows you to set your own preferences by defining the intensity of the vibration on various
events.
